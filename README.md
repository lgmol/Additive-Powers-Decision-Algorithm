This is an implementation of an algorithm which decides whether or not certain infinite words generated by morphisms are additive k-power-free.  The algorithm was first described in [3], and has since been used in [1] and [2].

The algorithm was implemented primarily by Jonathan Andrade.  For details regarding the implementation, see [1].
